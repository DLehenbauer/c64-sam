## About
The source contained in this repository was disassembled from the C64 version and documented by leveraging several pre-existing resources (see [notes](docs/notes.md)).

## History
Released in 1982, SAM was the first commercial all-software voice synthesizer.  Originally authored by Mark Barton for the Apple II, SAM was ported to the Atari 400/800 and C64 later the same year.

For more about the history of SAM, I recommend the excellent interview with Mark in [ANTIC episode 385](https://ataripodcast.libsyn.com/antic-interview-385-software-automatic-mouth-mark-barton).

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Mark Barton for creating SAM and for permission to release this source on GitHub.
